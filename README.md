# Hi, I'm Fayez! 👋  

### **Director of Software Engineering | Industrial Automation | Marble Technologies**  

## About Me
I lead software engineering at [Marble Technologies](https://www.seemarble.com), where we're revolutionizing the meat processing industry through innovative automation solutions. Our mission is to transform manual labor-intensive processes into efficient, data-driven operations.

## What We Do at Marble Technologies
We specialize in automating packoff lines in beef processing plants to address critical industry challenges:

- **Reducing Manual Labor**: Our systems eliminate the need for 15-20 workers per shift who previously had to manually search and move vacuum-sealed sub-primals from conveyor to box
- **Improving Efficiency**: Workers handling clods in a typical facility move over 18 million pounds of beef annually - our technology drastically reduces this physical burden
- **Enhancing Data Collection**: Our paired hardware and software systems sort cuts and deliver them directly to employees, while gathering valuable product data

## My Focus Areas
- Architecting scalable **distributed systems** for industrial automation
- Developing **real-time data processing** pipelines
- Implementing **AI-driven solutions** for the meat processing industry
- Leading **DevOps, security, and infrastructure** across cloud and on-premises environments
## Philosophy
> Nothing is built on stone; All is built on sand, but we must build as if the sand were stone - *Jorge Luis Borges*

In software engineering, particularly for industrial automation, I embrace this mindset. We create robust solutions in an ever-changing technological landscape, building systems that stand firm despite the shifting foundations beneath them.
